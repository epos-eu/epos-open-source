| **Cohesion** | Cohesion refers to how well the individual elements within an application work together. As a general rule, developers should aim to build loosely-coupled, highly-cohesive software systems. The reason being, highly-cohesive systems tend to be more robust, reliable, and reusable than those with low cohesion.<br>[https://www.tiempodev.com/blog/microservices/#:\~:text=Microservice%20architecture%20is%20often%20achieved,language%2Dagnostic%20APIs%20like%20REST](https://www.tiempodev.com/blog/microservices/#:\~:text=Microservice%20architecture%20is%20often%20achieved,language%2Dagnostic%20APIs%20like%20REST)) |

| **Decoupling** | Microservice architecture is often achieved by decoupling a monolithic application into independent modules that each contain the components necessary to execute a single business function. <br>([https://www.tiempodev.com/blog/microservices/#:\~:text=Microservice%20architecture%20is%20often%20achieved,language%2Dagnostic%20APIs%20like%20REST](https://www.tiempodev.com/blog/microservices/#:\~:text=Microservice%20architecture%20is%20often%20achieved,language%2Dagnostic%20APIs%20like%20REST)) |
