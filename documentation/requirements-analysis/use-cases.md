# Use Cases

To facilitate the development of the Integrated Core Services (ICS) several Use Cases were defined by the different scientific communities (TCS).

These use cases are in many cases the expression of communities' current status and communities practices, as they address domain-specific scientific cases. In other cases, use cases address multi-disciplinary use cases in a very generic way.

As such, these were used as guidelines for the next Design and Implementation steps, rather than strict and well-defined indications about what users need.

## Use Case Documents

The defined Use Cases are described in detail in the following documents:
