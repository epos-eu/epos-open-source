Requirements and processes are described form a User (agent or human) perspective. We identified and analysed 3 main Users Stories: 

* Access and use of scientific (meta)data 
* Metadata Management 
* Agent interoperating with specific metadata formats endpoints 


For each User Story we defined: 

* User Story Description - User stories generically describe the expectations of the users and how a generic user wants to interact with the system. Users can be human or agents. User stores are written together with the users (customers). 
* Macro processes describe the system usage from a user or agent perspective. Compared to the user stories, this is a more formal descriptions of user/system interactions. Each step in the macro processes is a process itself, and is described in the “Process Description” section. 
* Use Cases Definition - For each step (user processes) in the macro processes, we describe the required process in terms of UML diagrams, preconditions etc. 
* Flat Marker Diagram – Represent a sketch mock up view of the system 
* Process Definition – A detail description of each use case using BPNM notation
