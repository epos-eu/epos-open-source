  "title": "What Are EPOS Goals?",
  "text": "The EPOS overarching goal is to establish a comprehensive multidisciplinary research platform for the Earth sciences in Europe, aiming to represent a scientific vision and approach that enables innovative multidisciplinary research for a better understanding of the physical processes controlling earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, unrest episodes, and tsunamis, as well as those driving tectonics and Earth surface dynamics. EPOS seeks to establish a long-term plan to facilitate the integrated use of data, models, and facilities from existing and new distributed research infrastructures (RIs) for solid Earth science. Additionally, it aims to adopt appropriate legal solutions to manage distributed pan-European Research Infrastructures, securing a common and shared data policy that ensures open access and transparent use of data while guaranteeing mutual respect for intellectual property rights."
