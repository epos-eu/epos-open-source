  "text": "EPOS is composed of a variety of Earth Science stakeholders working together to integrate a set of diverse European Earth Science National Research Infrastructures into a single interoperable platform. The program will develop implementation plans and leverage new e-science opportunities to monitor and understand the dynamic and complex solid Earth system. The four key elements of EPOS architecture include National Research Infrastructures (NRIs), EPOS ERIC, Thematic Core Services, and Integrated Core Services, which serve as the scientific and technical backbone of the entire initiative. The NRIs participating in the EPOS integration plan are already operational and provide access to data and services for specific communities at a national level. Collectively, European countries possess a mosaic of hundreds of impressive but separated NRIs, encompassing geophysical networks, observatories, temporary deployments, laboratories, and modeling facilities dedicated to solid Earth studies."
