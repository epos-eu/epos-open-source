The diagram in this section represents the implementation of the conceptual architecture.

![image](./architecture-diagram.png)

The following key aspects need to be taken into account:

* Each of the _services_ in the conceptual design is rendered as one or more _services_ in the Technical Design.

* Blue services represent functionalities that implement request by specific RESTful APIs endpoints, namely:

| Service Name | Endpoint | Description |
|--|--|--
| Resources Service | /api/resources-service/v1/ | Service for accessing assets stored in the ICS-C catalogue |
| External Access Service | /api/external-access-service/v1/ | Service for executing external services (from TCS) |
| Backoffice Service | /api/backoffice-service/v1/ | Service for managing metadata from the backoffice application |

* In addition, the following services have been supplied with RESTful APIs:

| Service Name | Description |
|--|--|
| Converter Service | Service to convert from one data format to another data format. This might be useful for external users that wish to convert metadata on demand |
| Ingestor Service | Service for populate at once metadata catalogue by means of TTL EPOS-DCAT-AP files |

Messaging: 

The Routing Framework defines the routing of each message. The idea here is to embed the routing path into the message header in order to avoid messages to go back to the Routing Framework at each step (for being routed to the next service).

This choice is motivated by the fact that a centralized management of the messaging (i.e. Routing Framework taking decision at each step of the path) increases the amount of messaging in the queue with connecting the service to the queuing system, managing the connections; the generation and sending/receiving of messages.

* _Routing Framework_: This framework decides which path a message must follow to aggregate the necessary information. This decision is made on the basis of a rule.

In order to implement this, once a request has been made on a service, the following happen:

* Inside the service:
  * Once a request has been made to the service's RESTful API, the Routing Framework activates a request-specific rule
  * The Routing Framework, through the rule, deploys a path that includes the service required to aggregate the information
  * The RoutingFramework creates the message to be sent to the Queuing System and put the information about the routing path in the message header
* On the queueing system, "across services":
  * At each step, on the basis of the route written in the header, the message is properly sent to the right queue (hence right service).
  * In case of conditionals or decisions, the deployed route will contain the originator service, so that appropriate decision can be made by the Routing Framework.
